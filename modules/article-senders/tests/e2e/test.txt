turn out - 생산하다. 
consume - 소비하다.
evenly - 동일하게

we're consistent. - 우리는 동의한다.

No one wants to die
Even people who want to go heaven don't want to die to get there
And yet(=but) death is the destination we all share
No one has ever escaped it
And that is as it should be 그렇게 되어야만 하는 것처럼 입니다.
because Death is very likely the single(오직 하나의) best invention of Life.
it is Life's change agent.
it clears out the old to make way for the new
